# scrapekit

Did you know the entire web was made of data? You probably did.
Scrapekit helps you get that data with simple Python scripts. Based on
[requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/), the library will handles
caching, threading and logging.

### Why not Scrapy?

[Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a much more mature and comprehensive
framework for developing scrapers. On the other hand, it requires you to
develop scrapers within it's class system. This can be too heavyweight
for a simple script to grab data off a web site.
