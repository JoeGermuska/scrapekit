   contain the root `toctree` directive.

scrapekit: get the data you need, fast.
=======================================

.. toctree::
   :hidden:

Many web sites expose a great amount of data, and scraping it can help you build
useful tools, services and analysis on top of that data. This can often be done
with a simple Python script, using few external libraries.

As your script grows, however, you will want to add more advanced features, such
as **caching** of the downloaded pages, **multi-threading** to fetch many pieces
of content at once, and **logging** to get a clear sense of which data failed to
parse.

Scrapekit provides a set of useful tools for these that help with these tasks, 
while also offering you simple ways to structure your scraper. This helps you to
produce **fast, reliable and structured scraper scripts**.
